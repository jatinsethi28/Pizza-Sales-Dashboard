📊 Check out my recent project, "Pizza Sales Analysis," where I used Tableau to develop an interactive annual sales report for the year 2015.

🔍 The main objective was to help the store owner understand customer buying behavior and identify key factors influencing sales. From data cleaning and preparation to insightful visualization, I built a dynamic dashboard that showcases the overall performance of the Pizza store.

💡 Key skills I strengthened during this project:

* Data Cleaning & Transformation

* Data Analysis

* Interactive Dashboards

* Visual Storytelling with Tableau

Using features like calculated fields, filters, parameters, and various visual elements—such as bar charts, area charts, donut charts ,line charts and bubble charts—I was able to uncover meaningful trends and patterns.

📈 Key Insight: The store should focus on boosting weekday revenue and improving the sales performance of XL-sized pizzas.

With Tableau, anyone can harness the power of data to uncover insights and make data-driven decisions. Let data guide your next big move!
